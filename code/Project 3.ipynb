    "Suppose Santa is trying to speed up the already quick present-giving process on Christmas Eve. Instead of going to the roof of every building on Olin's campus, he decides to land on West Hall and launch all his presents to the tops of the other four buildings. He has a launcher that can launch presents at any velocity and angle that he desires (because Santa is an engineer). He is designing his launcher and needs to know which is a reasonable design that'll get the job done. He is debating between a launcher that uses a spring and a launcher with motors (refer to images below).\n",
